Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

### Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering 
Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

### Acknowledgments
The <a href= "http:https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data"> Ames Housing dataset</a> was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
